# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We currently support the latest `dev` branch and tagged releases (0.x.y). Older tags may not receive fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do NOT open a public issue for security problems.

Instead, email: `kmgurmia@gmail.com` with:
- Description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce / PoC
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (optional)

We aim to respond within 5 business days.

## Disclosure Process
1. We validate the report.
2. We prepare and test a fix.
3. We coordinate a release and acknowledge reporter (if desired).

## Scope
Runtime vulnerabilities (logic, data leakage), dependency CVEs in direct use, or sensitive information exposure.

UI bugs or non‑security crashes should be filed as regular issues instead.
